<h1>My Life in China</h1>
<p>I was borned in Guangdong, China. I went to pre-k in a town called Doushan. The place was pretty peaceful and pretty much everyone knows each other. My mom, brother and I stayed in an apartment owned by my aunt. It was pretty peaceful until I torched my cousin's room. Although it was a really big fire, no one got hurt because everyone escaped on time. </p>
<h1>Adventure to the United States</h1>
<P> I was finishing my first semester in third grade and I was told that I'm going to the United States. My mom, brother and I packed our stuffs and head to the airport without any knowledges of the English language. We arrived at the JFK airport after a 24 hours ride from China and a transfer at Seoul, South Korea. My dad picked us up at the JFK airport. </P>
