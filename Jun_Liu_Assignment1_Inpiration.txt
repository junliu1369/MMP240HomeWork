Assignment 1:Inspiration

Content Site
https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump
 The reason why I choose Twitter as the content inspirational site because of our President Trump. I have never seen a president that uses the social media platform to make news, policies, and jokes. People from other country is following our president via Twitter and they start using his twitter username to create accounts on other social media platform to imitate him.

Design Site
https://www.flightclub.com/
I will pick the flightclub website as my design inpiration website. The website had a clean look. The combination of the background color, font type, font size, font color and the images are amazing. The preview image for each shoe is always the same white background and shows the right side of the right shoe. 



Functionality Site
http://www.kissanime.ru/
The reason I choose this as my Functionality Site inpiration because I am a fan of anime. This website provide free streaming for anime from other countries. I like the way the can upload as soon as the English Subbed anime are released. I also like how they ranked the new season anime so it will help us consider what to watch. The way they group anime into different genre or season is also a smart thing to do.
